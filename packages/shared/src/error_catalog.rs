//! The reviewed catalog of every public contract error.
//!
//! The error enums in this crate define the codes. This module says what each
//! code means to a caller: what caused it, whether retrying can ever help,
//! what a client should do about it, and what a client may safely say to an end
//! user.
//!
//! The catalog is machine-readable so that three things can be checked rather
//! than asserted in prose, all of them in `tests/error-catalog/`:
//!
//! * every enum variant has a catalog entry with a matching code, so a new
//!   error cannot be added without being documented;
//! * the codes in [`docs/errors.md`](../../../docs/errors.md) and in the golden
//!   fixture match the catalog, so renumbering or reuse is caught;
//! * the codes the contracts actually return on each failure path match the
//!   catalog, so the documentation describes the deployed behaviour rather than
//!   the intended one.
//!
//! ## Codes are stable
//!
//! A published code is never reused for a different meaning and never
//! renumbered. Clients pin behaviour to the number, not to the variant name.
//! Removing an error is a breaking change; adding one is not, provided clients
//! follow the unknown-code rule below.
//!
//! ## Unknown codes
//!
//! A client will eventually meet a code that did not exist when it was written.
//! [`domain_for`] classifies any `u32` by range so that an unknown code is
//! still attributable to a contract, and [`retry_for`] answers the only
//! question that matters at that moment: an unknown code is never
//! automatically retried. See
//! [`docs/backend-integration.md`](../../../docs/backend-integration.md) for a
//! worked example.
