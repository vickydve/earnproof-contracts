//! Durability-class compatibility gate.

//! This module drives a full lifecycle across all three contracts, reads back
//! the namespaces that actually appear in each durability class, and compares
//! them against the inventory in `earnproof-shared`. It is the test that fails
//! when a `DataKey` variant is added, renamed, or written to a class the
//! inventory does not claim.
